# Data Challenge #ref L1

This is a public repository of a data engineering challenge.

To keep it fair to the authors of this challenge, details about the instructions are encrypted. If you want to view them for a potential offer to me, please contact me for the `gpg` encryption key. `gpg -d file.gpg`. To use it you need `gnupg`.
